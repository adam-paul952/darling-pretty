## Darling Pretty Photography

### **Description**

Darling Pretty Photography is the name of a friends photography company. She approached me when I began learning to code and asked if it would be possible to make her a website that would allow her clients to book their sessions online and have all the data handled behind the scenes as opposed to how she handles it all now with a pen and paper.

Originally, I began to write this project with React Javascript, but as I've been trying to learn TypeScript, I've been migrating the files over.
